1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

DONE. Stored in my local system in the location /home/cloudera/assignments/sales_order_data.csv



2. Store raw data into hdfs location

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /assignments

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/assignments/sales_order_data.csv /assignments



3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ Hive
hive> use assignments;
create table sales_order_data_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");



4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath '/assignments/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_data_csv;



5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_order_data_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;



6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

FROM sales_order_data_csv INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_order_data_orc SELECT *;



Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculate total sales per year

hive> SELECT year_id, SUM(sales) as total_sales
    > FROM sales_order_data_orc
    > GROUP BY year_id;

OUTPUT:

year_id     total_sales             
2003        3516979.547241211
2004        4724162.593383789
2005        1791486.7086791992



b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

hive> SELECT productcode, COUNT(ordernumber) AS total_orders
    > FROM sales_order_data_orc
    > GROUP BY productcode
    > ORDER BY total_orders DESC
    > LIMIT 1;
    
OUTPUT:
S18_3232   52



c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quarterly sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
